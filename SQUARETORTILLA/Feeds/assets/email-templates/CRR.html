        <p><strong>Dear Charles Rutenberg Realtors</strong>,</p>
        <p><img src="http://img.tx2me.com.s3.amazonaws.com/emailimages/CRR-iPhone.png" width="200" style="float:left; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom:10px;" />In following the current marketing trends, I acquired a mobile technology for our brokerage a few months ago. This mobile app, powered by MobilityRE, allows consumers to search for properties on the MLS (including land,rentals and commercial) from their mobile devices from wherever they are. The best part is that every listing they look at, whether it's ours or not, will have our contact information, thus generating leads. Also, a great listing tool. The entire MLS is branded to us.</p>
        <p>I have negotiated a deal with MobilityRE for all of our Realtors to have your own branded app. So every listing that gets looked at through your own app, will have your contact information, the entire MLS will be branded to each of you. The app tracks the user's activity and notifies you in real time (via text/email) of what properties they are looking at,they can even schedule a showing from it, again, notifying you of it! Also, the app has an IDX feed tied into the MLS to ensure accuracy with regular updates. So, no more using the Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com apps, etc. Now, you'll have your own, branded mobile home search app to give to your clients.</p>
        <p>This is a great tool to have and to offer, however, it won't do you any good if you don't share it and if you don't tell people you have it. Very user friendly, so the name of the game here is to &quot;get the word out&quot;.</p>
        <p>The regular price for the app is $59.00/month and a one -time set up fee of $99.00 (No long term contract)<br />
          <strong style="color:red;">Charles Rutenberg Agents will only pay $10.00/month (No long term contract/No set up fee!)</strong> We will bill you the monthly fee.<br />
          <br />
          A series of (30 minutes) webinars will be scheduled to instruct you on how the app works and what it will do for your business.<strong style="color:red;"> I URGE ALL TO ATTEND SO YOU CAN GET INFORMED!</strong><br />
        </p>
        <p>Below is the webinar schedule. Once you pick the desire date/time, to join in, simply go to (on your browser): https://join.me  then, where it says &quot;Join in&quot;, enter code: MobilityRE10 For audio dial 1.805.309.5900 Conference ID: 741 834 776 VERY IMPORTANT!!</p>
        <p>After each webinar, which will be presented by Ozzie Feo (MobilityRE Consultant), he will be asking agents who wish to have their own app, to email him at: OZZIE@MOBILITYRE.COM and replying with &quot;YES I WANT MY APP&quot;. The agents who reply with &quot;YES&quot;, will have their own apps texted to their cell phones within minutes!</p>
